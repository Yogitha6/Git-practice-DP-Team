This repository is for using git knowledge, practicing various operations and understanding better.

## Usage:
Task 1: (Basic file modification and push)
Please add your name to the list of users below using git from command line via your local setup.
Push changes to the repository - should be visible on the UI in the main branch.

Task 2: (Modifying code, creating tags and pushing)
Add a function to do various math operations other than the ones already existing in the code.
Create a tag named v0.0.1
Push changes to the repository - should be visible on the UI in the main branch.

Task 3: (Working on branches)

Change some existing file in master branch.
Try to merge your branch into the master branch. 
Please observe the files and various changes in different branches.

Task 4: (Running into a conflict and resolution)
Find a partner and ask them to edit the same line as you are editing at the same time.
Try to mimic run into a merge conflict and resolve the merge conflict.
Please make sure to push the changes back after resolving a merge conflict.

Task 5: (Create a pull request)
Instead of making changes in your personal branch and trying to merge it to the master directly.
Please push your changes in to your personal branch and view them on the UI - web console.
Create a pull request and observe how others can review your code and how we can discuss changes 
to the code and once code review is done, how the file can be then merged into master.
